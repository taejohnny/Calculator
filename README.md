# Calculator

Designed using the Java programming language and Eclipse IDE.

Purpose:
    This program is designed to be a simple way for Umass Amherst students to calculate their GPA in
  a given semester. Although calculating GPA doesn't take very long, it can become tedious when you
  are someone like me, who is constantly checking their grades. The way Umass calculates its GPA is by
  first multiplying the number of credits in a class by the grade point value received in that class. This
  is done for all of the classes, and these resulting numbers are added up. This total number is then 
  divided by the total number of credits attempted in the semester. Again, this is a short process that 
  takes usually only 5 minutes, but with this calculator, the process can be just a couple of seconds. I
  initially made this program as a side project and a convenient way to calculate my grade in the future,
  but my friends have also taken a liking to this program and have asked to use this program many times.
